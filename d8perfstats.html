title: Drupal 8 Performance Profiling
layout: post
---


I tested three targets: Drupal 7 with no page cache, Drupal 8 with no page cache, and Drupal 8 with the page cache. Data was populated by the devel_generate module as described in the README for the OSS Performance repository. More detail on how I assembled the Drupal 8 repository is included in its own target folder's README. The database dump, static file assets, and settings files used are all included in the target folder for all three targets. (Obviously I'm aware that D7 core and D8 core are far from a 1:1 comparison for a dozen different reasons and that's not my intent -- D7 stats are included as useful but not all-determining background comparison.)

Each target was tested with a concurrency of 1 and 20 on the following 4 PHP runtimes:

- PHP 5.6
- PHP 7.0 (nightly build from 24 May)
- HHVM 3.7.1
- HHVM 3.7.1 w/ Repo Authoritative mode

For the unfamiliar, HHVM's "repo authoritative" mode is similar to PHP's `apc.stat = 0` in that it does not allow for changes to code files after the server has been booted. However, the restriction is actually more serious -- new code files cannot even be __added__ after the server is booted (as the codebase is compiled into memory at boot time) and eval() and create_function() cannot be used. This means that I had to do a little sorcery to pre-compile all of Core's Twig templates, and switched back to the standard PhpStorage\FileStorage class in the site settings. The setup script I used to do this is in the Drupal 8 target folder and run via Drush while the D8 target is being created.

The stats from the benchmarking tool (a thin layer on top of Siege) are available here: http://tiny.cc/d8perfstats. The raw JSON output (with more stats) is available for all targets on the second tab of the sheet.

In addition, I took performance profiles of most of the targets. Blackfire.io was used to profile all targets for PHP5, with 500 requests for D7 and page cached D8, and 100 for D8 with no page cache. (Because it is slow.) The Blackfire profiles are public and can be viewed/downloaded here:

D7: https://blackfire.io/profiles/b8de711a-20a7-4571-a8a7-c84f812b92b9/graph
D8 No Cache: https://blackfire.io/profiles/41ac1132-2602-43f9-aec1-eb4f8ad20203/graph
D8 Page Cache: https://blackfire.io/profiles/9b630106-eade-4f48-8ba1-a05e0c7d98cb/graph

I also used the Linux tools perf utility to profile HHVM during its 6 runs, recording a callgraph which profiles the requests and function calls. These files can be found here: https://paddedhelmets.s3.amazonaws.com/d8perfstats/index.html

Be warned: the contents of each of these zips are roughly 500 MB apiece. Once you have unzipped (`tar -xjf`) one of these files, you'll want to move the `.map` file to your `/tmp/` folder; this is where the perf tool looks for the function map files. Once you've done this, the data file's callgraph and profile info can viewed with perf, like so:

```
perf report -g -i d7-repoauth-perf.data
```

These tests were done on an AWS `c4.xlarge` instance class running the Ubuntu 14.04 AMI provided by Canonical. I originally picked this class because its RAM corresponds to the largest available Heroku Dyno type, the Performance (PX) Dyno, but it appears that the original PX Dynos were based on the `c1.xlarge` class (which had twice as many logical CPU cores.) It is not clear whether new PX Dynos are being provisioned as `c4.xlarge` or `c4.2xlarge`. Either way, the `c4.xlarge` has 4 logical cores and the results were fairly consistent -- minimal evidence of the "noisy neighbors" effect from virtualized hosting.
